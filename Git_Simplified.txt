I will make git simple for you just follow through:

Make sure you know you git remote repo url

eg https://github.com/john/project1.git <--- note 'project1' folder

This is the central repository for all people woking on project1, usually created by project owner.

They must give you the link to the repo url eg by email so as to copy the url

Once youre on the repo on the git website, look for the green tab 'Code' and copy the url of the project from there

2. project1 in the url can contain main project files in which case you will find main project files like src folder and pom.xml file (java project)

but if not then it probably contains other folders that do contain files like src folder and pom.xml

Just keep in mind that you will cd into those folders later on

If you already have the same project on your machine ensure it is in project1 folder

example: c:\code\project1

But try not to create the folder 'project1' manually, use git Desktop tool:

Download git Desktop tool from website: https://git-scm.com/download/win

How to use Git tool to clone project1 from git repo to your local machine?

1.1 Launch the git tool

1.2 Click 'Clone Existing repository'

1.3 'Source location' must be set eg. https://github.com/john/project1.git

'Target Location' must be set eg. c:\code\project1<--make sure 'project1' does Not exist yet so git can create it for you!!!

but you already have the path "c:\code\"

1.4 Click 'Clone'

3. If you can see the cloned files in your local machine, bravo!!

>>> Make sure files are edited before you try to push changes back to git repo!!!

This is one of major headache of

git when it doesnt detect any file changes to push back to the git repo

Just open files eg using an IDE and type space character or something in at least 1 file and save files

4. Launch terminal eg Command prompt in order to run git commands.

CD to c:\code\project1 on the terminal

eg: cd c:\code\project1

initialise git just in case it wasnt initilized:

c:\code\project1\git init
If you're working on the main folder add the files to your local repo

c:\code\project1\git add src
src contains important project files and asssuming 'src' is in project1 folder

c:\code\project1\git add pom.xml
pom.xml is an independet file in project1 folder

If you're also editing files in a folder within project1 (happens a lot) then do

c:\code\project1\git add subfolder\AnotherProject\src
Because you have edited those files as well

c:\code\project1\git add subfolder\AnotherProject\pom.xml
Now commit:

c:\code\project1\git commit -a
This commits only the changed files and folders (recommended)

git commit .
git commit . This commits all files and folders

Now pull to prepare and connect origin and master branch.

origin is remote repo

master is local repo on your machine

eg.

c:\code\project1\git pull origin master
Finally push to origin:

c:\code\project1\git push origin master
